# **MoneyLink** 🚀💸

Welcome to **MoneyLink** – Your gateway to **secure, transparent**, and **community-driven micro-lending**! 💡 Whether you're in a rural district or a bustling city, MoneyLink uses **Blockchain** and **Web3 technology** to revolutionize financial transactions, making them **safer** and **faster**. 🌐

## Features ✨

### 📱 **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Transaction Page**: A **well-organized** page where users can easily view all their previous transactions, including pending loans, repayments, and history.
- **Dashboard Page**: The central hub that displays your **credit score** 🔢, **loan status**, and **financial summary**. Color-coded indicators are used to display vital information clearly, such as **available balance**, **pending loans**, and **credit score**.
- **SHG (Self-Help Groups) Page**: Enables users to connect with **local communities** (SHGs) that can lend or borrow funds. This page encourages **community-based lending** where trust is built through peer relationships.
- **Request Money & Send Money Pages**: Users can **request money** from friends or lenders and **send money** using their mobile wallets. Integration with **Web3-enabled wallets** ensures that transactions are **fast**, **secure**, and **decentralized**.
- **Available Balance Page**: Displays the user’s **current balance**. The balance can be hidden or revealed by clicking an **eye icon**, ensuring privacy when necessary.

### 🤖 **Smart Chatbot**
- **AI-driven Assistant**: The chatbot helps guide users through the app, assisting with actions such as making transactions, checking the credit score, and finding local SHGs. 
- **Transaction Prediction (Models Trained yet need to be integrated with App)**: The chatbot also predicts the likelihood of a **successful transaction** by analyzing past behavior, repayment patterns, and user profiles.
- The chatbot gives users insights into **loan repayment probability** and can help them understand their **chances of being accepted for a loan** based on their history.

### ⚙️ **Blockchain-Powered Transactions**
- **Decentralized Financial Transactions**: Every transaction in the app is secured and logged using **Blockchain technology**, which provides a transparent and unchangeable record of every financial transaction.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** Transactions: Blockchain allows users to make **peer-to-peer transactions** directly with each other, reducing the need for intermediaries (e.g., banks or money transfer agencies) and cutting down transaction costs.
- All transactions are fully **secure**, **transparent**, and **traceable** without the involvement of central authorities.

### 📜 **Smart Contracts for Lending**
- **Automated Community-Based Lending**: Using **Smart Contracts**, the platform allows users to create **community-based lending agreements** without needing to trust each other directly. For example, **Self-Help Groups (SHGs)** or **peer lenders** can establish terms that automatically execute upon meeting conditions (such as repayment milestones).
- **Transparency & Accountability**: The use of smart contracts ensures that both lenders and borrowers can see **exact terms and conditions** clearly, and the contracts will automatically **enforce payments** based on agreed criteria, increasing trust and accountability.
- **Instant Loan Disbursements & Repayments**: Once conditions (such as loan repayment) are met, the smart contracts execute, ensuring the lender is paid back in real-time. This makes the entire lending process **automatic**, **fast**, and **without manual intervention**.

  ### 🔒 **User Authentication (Under Progress)**
- **Aadhaar Integration**: Users can log in using their **Aadhaar** ID for a quick, verified registration. Blockchain ensures that the identity is verified in a secure, tamper-proof manner, ensuring user safety and privacy.
- **Mobile Wallet Integration**: Users can link their **mobile wallets** (e.g., Paytm, Google Pay) for hassle-free transactions, making loan disbursements and repayments swift and secure.
- This feature supports **compliance with KYC norms**, ensuring **legal** and **safe onboarding** of users.

### 🏦 **Blockchain-Backed Credit Scoring**
- **Decentralized Credit Scoring**: Traditional credit scoring methods can be opaque and unreliable. MoneyLink provides a **decentralized credit scoring** system that evaluates users based on their **transaction history** and **repayment behavior**.
- **Transparent & Fair**: Credit scores are built on **verified blockchain data**, making the system **transparent** and **immutable**. Users can access and track their credit history, giving them more control over their financial standing.
- The system rewards **on-time repayments** and **consistent financial behavior**, offering **fairer chances** to users who may be underserved by traditional credit systems.
